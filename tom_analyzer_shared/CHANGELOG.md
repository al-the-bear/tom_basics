# Changelog

## 0.1.0

- Initial release. Extracted summary-caching infrastructure from
  `tom_reflection_generator` into a reusable library so multiple code
  generators (reflection, d4rt bridges, ...) can share the same
  `<workspace>/.tom/analyzer-cache/` directory.
- Public API:
  - `PackageDependency`, `DependencySet`
  - `DependencyResolver` (parses `pubspec.lock`, locates hosted/SDK
    package sources)
  - `SummaryCacheManager` (reads/writes `{name}@{version}.sum` files)
  - `SummaryGenerator` (generates the SDK summary and per-package
    summaries in topological order)
  - `runSummaryCacheStage()` and `SummaryCacheResult` — reusable
    orchestration helper that resolves dependencies, generates missing
    summaries, and returns the paths to pass to
    `AnalysisContextCollectionImpl`.
